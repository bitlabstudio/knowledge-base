# Javascript > ReactJS > Hello World

If you have never heard about ReactJS, the first thing you should do is to try
to install it and just get a first "Hello World" app up and running.

Follow the [official installation instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/installation.html) for
"Create New App".

* run `create-react-app my-app`
* `cd` into the new `my-app` folder
* run `yarn start`
* --> `http://localhost:3000/` should open in your browser

Make a change in `my-app/src/App.js` and save the file. You should see the
change in the browser immediately.
