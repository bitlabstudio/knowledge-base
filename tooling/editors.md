# Tooling > Editors & Plugins

## Vim bindings

It is strongly recommended to use Vim-bindings for all your every-day work.

It vastly speeds up navigation in big files and reduces strain on your wrists
because you don't have to move your fingers between typing-position and
arrow-keys or even mouse.

## Code formatting

We shall not waste time on mundane things like code-formatting, if these things
can be automated. If your editor does not have plugins for the code formatters
that we use, then you must chose a different editor!

* for JavaScript code, we use https://github.com/prettier/prettier
* for Python code we use https://github.com/google/yapf
